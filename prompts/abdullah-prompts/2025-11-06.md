**prompt** i want to Implement a backend POST API (api/location/farm-wizard/) that parses an array of farm + field objects, creates or updates hierarchical location entries in MongoDB, and generates lifecycle events for fields in add mode, following the above structure and logic.

# Backend Logic — farmSetup()
## When POST /api/location/farm-wizard/ is called: 
1. farmSetup() method (inside locationService) should handle the parsing.
2. Identify whether the request is in Add mode or Edit mode:
    2.1. If no _id is present on the farm or fields → Add mode.
    2.2. If _id exists → Edit mode.
3. Add Mode:
    3.1. Create the Farm Location first.
    3.2. Use its _id as parentId for each Field.
    3.3. For each Field created, call a helper function
        → createFieldLifeCycleEvents(field)
        to generate events related to that field (growth stages, irrigation schedule, etc.).
4. Edit Mode:
    4.1. Update the existing Farm and Field records with new attributes and geometry.
    4.2. Only basic information about farm/fields can change.

# Your task:
1. Create a new POST API at api/location/farm-wizard/.
2. In the controller, call farmSetup() from locationService.
3. Implement farmSetup() to:
    3.1. Parse the locations array.
    3.2. Create or update farm and field Location.
    3.3. If in add mode → call createFieldLifeCycleEvents() for each field.

# The API will receive the following structure:
var locations = [
  {
    // Farm object
    typeId: "<FarmTypeId>",
    name: "Green Valley Farm",
    attributes: {
      geometry: { ...GeoJSON... },
      area_ha: 25,
      soilType: "Loamy"
    }
  },
  {
    // Field objects (one or multiple)
    typeId: "<FieldTypeId>",
    parentId: "<farm_id or null if new>",
    name: "Field 1",
    attributes: {
      geometry: { ...GeoJSON... },
      cropType: "Wheat",
      soilType: "Sandy",
      lifecycle: "2025-01-01 to 2025-06-30"
    },
    fieldEventsInfo: {
      // contains related stage info for event generation
      stage: "Sowing",
      expectedYield: 50,
      irrigationFrequency: "Weekly"
    }
  }
];
## NOTE: this is only a sample data in the above structure, just for your understanding.

# first write the implementation in /docs. without my confirmation don't continue. 

**prompt** continue please
