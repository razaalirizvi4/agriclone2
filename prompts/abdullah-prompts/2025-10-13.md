# I want to generate a Location management module for an agriculture system.

## Goal:
Build a complete Express + MongoDB-based API for managing location entities such as Farms and Fields.

## Data Model:
Each location will be stored in a single collection called "locations".

### Example Schema:
{
  "_id": "",
  "type": "Farm" | "Field" | "Building" | "Road" | "Truck",
  "name": "",
  "parentId": "",
  "owner": {
    "id": "",
    "email": "",
    "name": ""
  },
  "attributes":{

  }
}

# now create a simple frontend in client folder for this location module
# Implementation: create a new file named as location.md and first write all the implentation in that file
