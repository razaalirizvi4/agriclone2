**Prompt** i want to create a setup wizard to enter farm and field details.

Wizard Structure:

First Page (Farm Details):

The page has two parts:

A form to take written details like Farm Name, Address, and Area.

A Map section using Mapbox where the user can pin the farm location, draw or edit boundaries, and import or export GeoJSON or CSV files of their farm.

The address should be verified through the pinned location before continuing.

At the end, the user enters how many fields they want to divide the farm into and proceeds to the next page.

Second Page (Field Management):

The map section remains, but it includes a table overlay showing all fields.
The farmer can select a field from the table and resize or edit its boundaries directly on the map.

A form section for selecting and filling crop details depending on the crop stage (existing or new crop).

There’s a crop collection in the app, and the crops are shown in a dropdown list.

When a crop is selected, its crop ID should be stored inside that field’s object as cropId.

A third section records field events such as sowing, fertilizer application, irrigation, pesticide spraying, harvesting, and land preparation for the next crop.
Each event includes a date and details like type and quantity.

Data Model:
All farm and field data are stored as a single structured object.

Farms have parentId: null.

Fields have the parentId equal to their farm’s ID.

Each field can contain a cropId and a list of events.

Example structure:

{
  entities: [
    {
      id: "farm1",
      name: "Maarij’s Farm",
      parentId: null,
      area: "120 acres",
      boundaries: { ... },
      location: { lat: 33.684, lng: 73.047 }
    },
    {
      id: "field1",
      name: "North Field",
      parentId: "farm1",
      cropId: "crop1",
      events: [
        { eventType: "Sowing", date: "2025-01-10" },
        { eventType: "Irrigation", date: "2025-02-01" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  crops: [
    { id: "crop1", name: "Wheat" },
    { id: "crop2", name: "Rice" },
    { id: "crop3", name: "Corn" }
  ]
}


I want the project to include:

A React Context (or Redux) to manage all this data.

Integration with Mapbox for map editing and boundary drawing.

Support for import/export of GeoJSON and CSV files.

Clean, organized folder structure with components, features, and context separated.
