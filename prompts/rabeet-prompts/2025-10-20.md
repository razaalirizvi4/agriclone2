## Prompts for 2025-10-20

1. **Prompt:**  what data is getting loaded in client\src\components\ViewModel\useMapViewModel.js? it's not loading the data from DB, I want to load the data from DB into the mapbox component.

2. **Prompt:** great working, i want to differentiate between farm and field layers farm should be visible and upon click farm highlight go away and field highlight enables.

3. **Prompt:** I also want to select a specific field and store that state in redux store, so my whole dashboard can vary according to selected field but right now just the weather component is directly linked so update that.
