## Prompts for 2025-10-22

1. **Prompt:** i want to edit this client\src\pages\Home.jsx, such that when the map initializes it show the selected field highlighted and the selected field should be properly visible too with some dark shade by updating css. write down these implementation steps first in doc\Weather_Component_custom.md with a new section at end of file.

2. **Prompt:** the selectedfieldid is already getting passed with props, the calculatecenter function needs to be updated. and the css file too, just update the implementation steps and wait for my confirmation to start working.
