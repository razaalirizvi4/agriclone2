## Prompts for 2025-10-14

1. **Prompt:** help me in understanding of this eventStream feature in this project whose implementation is written in this file: "doc\eventStream.md" just read only this file and help me understand how it is working and how to use eventstream?

2. **Prompt:** I want to create the component for client\src\components\View\Weather.jsx, first i want you to Update the implementation in doc\Weather_Component.md this file, then wait for my approval then implement. The details of the component are:

- It should be based on the MVVM structure as we're doing in this project.
- a weather widget component that looks like a compact dashboard card.

- The card has a header titled “Weather” on the left.

- Below the header, show the current weather section with:

- A circular background icon (for example, a Sun icon inside a yellow circle).

- Next to it, the current temperature (large text) and condition (small text).

- Beneath that, a small text line showing humidity percentage.

- Then add a “3-Day Forecast” section showing three rows — Today, Tomorrow, and Sunday.

- Each row has an icon (Sun, Cloud, or Rain), the day name, and the high/low temperatures aligned on the right.

- The layout should use a modern, clean design with rounded corners, light background, padding, and spacing between sections — similar to a Figma-style UI card.

- The design should look consistent with all the css of it implemented in client\src\App.css

- For sample data, use the same way as we did in this client\src\data\farms.js and then in client\src\data\dashboardSchema.js passed the data as props. so the generic layout stay's consistent.

- see this business layer client\src\components\ViewModel\useMapViewModel.js and don't change the dashboardschema pattern, keep it consistent in this:
   {
   key: "map",
   component: "Map",
   props: { geoJSON: "farmsGeoJSON" },
   colSpan: 8,
   order: 1,
   },
   {
   key: "weather",
   component: "Weather",
   props: {},
   colSpan: 4,
   order: 2,
   },


3. **Prompt:** In doc\Weather_Component.md, update it such that no node_modules would be read or updated by gemini cli.
