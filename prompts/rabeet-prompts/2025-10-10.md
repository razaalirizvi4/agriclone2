## Prompts for 2025-10-09

1. **Prompt:** in the client\src\data\dashboardSchema.js i also want to provide order for layout too, so the user can also change the order of each component. like colspan add another entity named order then the  schema should become something like this:
export const dashboardSchema = [
  {
    key: "map",
    component: "Map",
    props: { geoJSON: "farmsGeoJSON" },
    colSpan: 8,
    order:1,
  },
  {
    key: "weather",
    component: "Weather",
    props: {},
    colSpan: 4,
    order:2,
  },
  {
    key: "crop",
    component: "CropLifeCycle",
    props: {},
    colSpan: 12,
    order:3,
  },
];

First add all implementation steps into this file doc\dashboard-implementation.md. and then start implementing after my approval.
