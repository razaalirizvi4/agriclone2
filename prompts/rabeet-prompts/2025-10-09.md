## Prompts for 2025-10-09

1. **Prompt:** i want client\src\pages\Home.jsx to be a generic dashboard, instead of the hardcoded one. Like pass some layout related data from another file and provide all the components as props to it. First write it's implementation steps in doc\dashboard-implementation.md you can change the previous one's if they're no longer valid.
2. **Prompt:** You have to approve implementation from me first, i dont want sections division. what if we go for colspan division into 12 for whole dashboard.

3.**Prompt:** i want to pass only one object like this which will include colspan. something like this:
// dashboardSchema.js
export const dashboardSchema = [
{
key: "map",
component: "Map",
props: { geoJSON: "farmsGeoJSON" },
colSpan: 8
},
{
key: "weather",
component: "Weather",
props: {},
colSpan: 4
},
{
key: "crop",
component: "CropLifeCycle",
props: {},
colSpan: 12
}
];

    I want to keep it like a generic component, it should be taking accessors as given in schema. and there should be a lookup for all the available components.
