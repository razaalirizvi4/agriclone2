### Context: I’m working on a web application that handles various dates (e.g., creation date, update date, transaction date, etc.) in different parts of the app. Currently, the date formatting is inconsistent across components and services.

### Requirements: Define a single utility function in the utils folder that formats all dates consistently. The desired format is YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2025-10-11). Ensure this function is reusable and imported everywhere date formatting is needed (API responses, UI displays, database entries, etc.). Replace any direct date formatting with this utility to maintain consistency across the entire app.

### Output: Generate the code implementation for the date utility function (e.g., formatDate.js) and show how to utilize it in a few different parts of the app — like in a service file, a React component, and a backend route handler.

### Make the top border of each event taller and more visible. Use green for completed events and red for pending ones, so status is clear even without viewing the timeline.
